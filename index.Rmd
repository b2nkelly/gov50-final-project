## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the correlation between performance and money spent by professional soccer clubs, and finding out whether they have a direct correlation or not.



## Finding Data and Writing a Proposal

In the world of soccer, is there a direct correlation between money spent by clubs and performance? In this study, I plan to examine whether or not the money that clubs spend on transfers for players has a direct correlation with the performance of the team: total wins, trophies won, and rank in the league. I hypothesize that, generally, the clubs that spend more money on transfers are the ones who have the most success. I believe there will be a correlation because when more money is spent, the players in the club are generally at a higher level and have more impact into performance of the team as a whole. My sample is composed of all transfers made by clubs in the English Premier League from 1992-2022. The explanatory variable of interest is success which is composed of club's total wins, trophies won, and rank in the league and whether or not there is a correlation to money spent on transfers. We can consider a club successful based off of these success statistics and then we can compare that success to how much money the club has spent. We want to see if the higher spending clubs generally have more success. For example, Manchester City is a relatively new powerhouse in soccer now, but only after they had a Saudi Arabian owner take over in the 2000s and pump lots of money into the club. We want to see if this is a general trend in soccer or if this is a peculiar example. If there are enough examples that disprove this theory, which would be low-spending clubs that have high success or high-spending clubs that have low success, we can consider our hypothesis disproved. However, if the majority of clubs follow this trend, we can consider our hypothesis to be true.

## Analysis

In the graph above, we are comparing total money spent on transfers and total points since 1992. Total money spent on transfers is the total amount of money, in millions, spent on new players by a club. Total points is calculated by adding three points for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. As seen in the graph, on average, there is a positive correlation between money spent on transfers and total points. There are of course some outliers like Arsenal, Chelsea, and Man City. Arsenal has the second-most total points despite only spending 2.496 billion on transfers. While this may seem like a lot, compared to the other teams with similar amounts of total points. Chelsea has spent the most money on transfers out of every premier league club since 1992, however, they have only the fourth-most total points. And finally, Man City has spent the second-most on transfers while only having the sixth-most total points. A reason to explain this is because of transfer inflation. Both Chelsea and Man City came into riches recently, meaning that they have been spending money, translating into success within the last 15-20 years. Because of transfer inflation, players have been getting sold for more and more money as time has gone on, meaning that both Chelsea and Man City have been buying players at a higher price since they came into money recently. This has translated to success in the more recent years, however, before their new owners came in with lots of money to spend, both of these clubs struggled to perform as well as other clubs with more money relative to the time period. Arsenal is the inverse case in this situation, as they were very successful in the 1990s and 2000s, when players costed much less to acquire. They collected most of their points in this time period where they were able to buy the best players at the time for a much lower price than Chelsea and Man City are spending on the best players now. Because of this, they were very successful in those early years of the Premier League without having to spend too much money compared to what teams spend now. Ultimately, the explanation for why these outliers exist supports the fact that there is a positive correlation between money spent on transfers and total points.
