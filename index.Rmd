title: "Gov 50 Final Project"
author: "Ben Kelly"
description: "In this project, I will be looking at the world of soccer, and seeing if there is a direct correlation between money spent by clubs and performance. Are the better teams the ones who spend the most money, or is there a way for a club to succeed in soccer without owners who invest billions of dollars into the team? I will do this by plotting these variables against each other and seeing whether there is a correlation, and then analyzing this by looking at other variables and evidence to see whether there is a causation between the two."

## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the correlation between performance and money spent by professional soccer clubs, and finding out whether they have a direct correlation or not.
